# Earthquake Visualisation

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

 - The data that is pulled in this exercise is for [M1.0+ Earthquakes](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/1.0_week.geojson)

----

## Features:
- The size of each circle is proportionate to the magnitude of the earthquake.
- The colour of each circle is related to the depth of the earthquake.
- Clicking upon any circle will display the place the earthquake occurred, the magnitude, and the time of the event.

#### Code:
- This exercise was completed with the assistance of tutorial staff.
- The page has been deployed to [Github Pages](https://gigodata.github.io/projects/usgs_earthquakes/index.html) to see results.
